# Olympic Medal Winners Classification
In this case study, we'll look at the challenge of predicting Olympic medal winners using a variety of characteristics of athletes, their performances, and their backgrounds. Our objective is to develop a predictive model that can precisely predict which athletes will likely take home medals in upcoming Olympic Games , Based on each athlete's demographic information (age, gender, nationality), the sport they participate in, and their performance metrics (height, weight, prior medals won, etc.), we will specifically concentrate on predicting the medal class (gold, silver, bronze, or no medal) for each athlete in the dataset. There are four different medal classes, so this is a classification issue with multiple classes.
